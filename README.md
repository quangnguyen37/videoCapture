#Video Capture with python
Using cv2 to create a program that capture video through webcame and detect objects.

##Description
This program is designed to detect objects using OpenCV, a computer vision library in Python. It uses a pre-trained model to detect objects in an image or video stream, and then draws bounding boxes around the detected objects. The program can be customized to detect specific objects by adjusting the parameters and inputting the appropriate trained model.The program also has the ability to record the objects that are detected and store them in a CSV file. Furthermore, the program is designed to create interactive graphs that display the object detection data in a user-friendly way. This added functionality allows users to not only detect objects but also analyze and visualize the data in a more meaningful way.
